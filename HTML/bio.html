					Hey there. My name is Isaac Lohnes, and I'm currently studying IT Programming at Nova Scotia Community College. I live in Berwick,
					NS, and I study at the Center of Geographic Science, which is located in Lawrencetown NS. 
					</br>
					</br>
					My interests include Programming, building PCs, and Graphic Design. I work a lot in the Adobe Creative Cloud suite in my spare time,
					but most of my time currently is spent at NSCC. I also enjoy exercise, and am avidly involved in snowboarding and mountain biking.
